MAG_finder: An Automated MAG Assembly and Analysis Pipeline

MAG_finder is a comprehensive script designed to streamline the process of Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MAG) construction and analysis. This tool integrates several leading MAG assembly programs including MaxBin2, MetaBat2, CONCOCT, and COMEBin, facilitating an automated and efficient workflow. MAG_finder is tailored for researchers and bioinformaticians seeking to simplify the complex process of MAG assembly from metagenomic data.

Key Features:

Multi-Tool Integration: MAG_finder harnesses the power of multiple MAG construction tools, providing a broad and robust approach to assembly.
Automatic Workflow: From raw data to assembled genomes, the script manages each step automatically, saving time and reducing manual intervention.
Quality Control: Incorporated with CheckM, MAG_finder ensures the assembled MAGs meet high standards of quality and completeness.
Taxonomic Classification: Utilizing the advanced capabilities of GTDB-Tk, the script classifies the assembled MAGs, providing valuable insights into their taxonomic contexts.
Intended Use:
MAG_finder is ideal for microbial ecologists, genomic researchers, and bioinformaticians who are engaged in metagenomic studies and require an efficient tool to assemble, validate, and classify MAGs.

Getting Started:
To begin using MAG_finder, clone the repository, set up the necessary environments, and input your metagenomic data. The script will handle the rest, outputting high-quality MAGs ready for further analysis.

Elevate your metagenomic research with MAG_finder - an all-in-one solution for MAG assembly and analysis.
